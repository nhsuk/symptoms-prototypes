Common questions about acne and self-help tips

### Help if you’re feeling depressed because of your acne

The first step is to talk to your GP. They can recommend the right way forward. This might be talking to a therapist or other treatments. You’ll decide together with your GP what’s the right treatment for you. 

## If you don’t want to talk to your GP

If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your GP about the way you feel, you can contact a charity. 

They can help you with things like talking to other people about your problem.

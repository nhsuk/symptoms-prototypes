## What causes spots and acne

You get spots when your skin pores become blocked. This happens when the skin produces too much oil. The oil mixes with dead skin cells and forms a plug.

Bacteria can infect the blocked pore. This leads to spots.

Why skin can produce too much oil isn’t clear. It could be because of a hormone called testosterone. During puberty your body produces more testosterone. It’s possible that the testosterone tells the glands to produce more oil than is needed.

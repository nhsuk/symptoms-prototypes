## Moderate and severe acne

It’s important to see a GP for [moderate and severe acne](#) because these types of acne can leave scars. 

Try not to put this off. Even if your acne comes and goes and might sometimes look better you can still get scars.  

If you feel comfortable with it you can take a selfie when your acne is more severe. This can help your GP to find the right treatment for you. Don’t take pictures of your chest or breasts. 

Your GP will ask things like: 

- how long you’ve had acne
- if there are things you know of that make it worse
- how it’s affecting your life
- if there is anyone in your family with acne
- treatments you’ve used before

It’s also important that you tell your GP how your acne is affecting your life, for example your self confidence. 

### Treatments from your GP

Your GP will talk you through treatments that are suitable for your level of acne and your skin type. Together you can decide what to try first. 

Treating acne is not always straightforward and you might have to try different treatments. They can also take some time to work. It’s usually between 3 to 6 months before you start seeing a change. 

Make another appointment if the prescribed treatment doesn’t work within the time frame. It’s normal for people to go back to their GP about their acne. 

Your GP might also refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) to help with the treatment.

## A pharmacist can help with acne

For mild acne talk to a pharmacist first. They can recommend creams or gels. 

Ask for products with benzoyl peroxide. These are the only ones proven to reduce the number of spots.

## Alternative and natural remedies for acne

There is little proof to show that natural remedies such as using tea tree oil and herbal remedies help to treat acne.

## Seeing a doctor about acne {id="#doctor"}

If you’re worried about getting scars or your acne is making you unhappy, see a GP. They see people with acne all the time and will be able to help you. 

You can go on your own or bring someone with you. It’s important you feel comfortable when talking about your symptoms. 

## Mild acne

Your first step with mild acne is to see a pharmacist. It may take some time for the products they recommend to work. 

If your find products from the pharmacy don’t work, see your GP. 

## Moderate and severe acne

It’s important to see a GP for moderate and severe acne because they can leave scars. Sometimes it can be hard to make the decision to go and see someone but try not put it off. 

The GP will ask things like: 

- how long you’ve had acne
- if there are things you know of that make it worse
- how it’s affecting your life

You can speak freely with your GP. 

### Treatments from your GP

Your GP will talk you through treatments that are suitable for your level of acne and your skin type. Together you’ll decide what to try first. 

Treating acne is not always straightforward and you might have to try different treatments. They can also take some time to work. It’s usually between 2 to 6 months before you start seeing a change. 

Make another appointment if the prescribed treatment doesn’t work within the time frame. It’s normal for people to go back to their GP for acne. 

Your GP might also refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) to help with the treatment. 

## Comparing medicines {id="medicines"}

There are lots of medicines available to treat acne. These are the most common ones. 

### Gels and creams

## What causes spots and acne {id="causes"}

You get spots when your skin pores become blocked. This happens when the skin produces too much oil. The oil mixes with dead skin cells and forms a plug. 

Bacteria can infect the blocked pore. This leads to spots. 

Why your skin produces too much oil isn’t fully known. This could be because of a hormone called testosterone. During puberty your body produces more testosterone. It’s possible that the testosterone tells the glands to produce more oil than is needed. 

 Things that can make acne worse: 

- very humid air
- eating too much dairy 
- [polycystic ovarian disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- medicines such as steroids, hormones and anti-epileptic drugs

There is little evidence that foods, such as chocolate and fast foods, cause acne.

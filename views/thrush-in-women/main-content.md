## Check if you have thrush

Thrush symptoms include:

*  white discharge (like cottage cheese) which doesn’t usually smell
*  itching and irritation around the vagina
*  soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee

If you’re unsure it’s thrush check [vaginal discharge](/vaginal-discharge/).

### What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want to rule out other infections.  

* you'll be asked about your symptoms
* a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina
* a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge to test for other infections

You often get the results quicker from a sexual health clinic, typically 1 to 2 days, and around 1 week from you GP practice. 


## Thrush treatment

You'll need anti-fungal medicine to get rid of thrush. This can be tablet you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary) or a cream to relieve the irritation. 

Thrush should clear up after one dose, within a week. 

You don't need to treat partners, unless they have symptoms. 

### Recurrent thrush

You'll need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than twice in 6 months).  

Your GP or sexual health clinic can help you identify if something is triggering your thrush, such as your period or sex. 

### Your pharmacist can help with thrush

You can buy anti-fungal medicine from pharmacies if you've had thrush in the past and you know the symptoms.  

Your pharmacist can recommend the best treatment for you.  Ask if they have a private area to talk if you're embarrassed.

You shouldn't use antifungal medicine more than twice in 6 months without speaking to your pharmacist or doctor.

### Alternative and natural remedies

There’s little proof to show that natural remedies such as tea tree oil in the bath eating probiotic yogurts or capsules help thrush. Using tea tree oil can irritate the skin. 

## Causes of thrush

Thrush can be triggered by sex and sometimes passed on through sex, but it isn't a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

Thrush is caused by fungus and develops when balance of bacteria in your vagina changes. 

This can happen: 

* after the menopause
* when you’re pregnant
* if you have poorly controlled diabetes
* if you have a weak immune system - for example because of HIV or chemotherapy
* when you take antibiotics

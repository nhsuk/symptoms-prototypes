## Check if your vaginal discharge is normal 

Usually, vaginal discharge is not anything to worry about if it:

* doesn't have a strong or unpleasant smell
* is clear or white 
* is thick and sticky
* is slippery and wet (during your period) 

You can get vaginal discharge at any age. 

The amount of discharge varies. You usually get heavier discharge between periods, during pregnancy or if you’re sexually active or using birth control. 

## When it can be a sign of an infection 

If your discharge changes (for example, its smell, colour or texture) it might be a sign of an infection. 

| Discharge | Possible cause | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| smells fishy | [bacterial vaginosis](/bacterial-vaginosis/) | 
| thick and white (like cottage cheese) | [thrush](/thrush/) | 
| green or yellow | [trichomoniasis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Trichomonas_vaginalis/Pages/Introduction.aspx) | 
| with pelvic pain [or bleeding] | [chlamydia](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx) or [gonorrhoea](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gonorrhoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx) |

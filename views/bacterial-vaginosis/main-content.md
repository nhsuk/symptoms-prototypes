## See a GP or sexual health clinic if your discharge:

- has a strong fishy smell, particularly after sex
- is white or grey
- is thin and watery
!!!

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) doesn't usually cause any soreness or itching.

Some GPs and all sexual health clinics can test for BV. Call your GP first to see if they can test you.

If you’re unsure it’s bacterial vaginosis check [vaginal discharge](/vaginal-discharge/).

## What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want to confirm it's BV and rule out a sexually transmitted infection (STI). 

- you'll be asked about your symptoms
- a doctor or nurse will look at your vagina
- a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge inside your vagina to test for other infections 

This won't hurt, but may feel uncomfortable.

You often get the results quicker from a sexual health clinic, typically 1 to 2 days, and around 1 week from your GP practice.

## Treatment for bacterial vaginosis

BV is treated with antibiotic tablets or gel. 

If you are pregnant, it is safe to use treatment, even in the first 12 weeks.

There are treatments available at supermarkets and pharmacies that help relieve the symptoms, but they don't get rid of BV.

 Partners don’t need treatment.
 
### Recurring bacterial vaginosis

It's common for BV to come back. More than half of women treated for BV find their symptoms return, usually within 3 months. 

You’ll need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep getting BV (you get it more than twice in 6 months).

Your GP or sexual health clinic can help you identify if something is triggering your BV, such as your period or sex.

## What causes bacterial vaginosis

Bacterial vaginosis happens when there’s a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina. What causes this to happen isn’t fully known.

BV is not classed as an STI, but women who are sexually active and have had a change of partner are more likely to have it, including women in same-sex relationships.

## Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy

If you develop BV in pregnancy, there’ is a small risk of complications, such as premature birth or miscarriage.

However, BV causes no problems in the majority of pregnancies

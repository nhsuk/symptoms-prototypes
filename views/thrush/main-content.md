## Check if you have thrush

Thrush symptoms in women:

*  white discharge (like cottage cheese) which doesn’t usually smell
*  itching and irritation around the vagina 
*  soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee

If you’re unsure it’s thrush check [vaginal discharge](/vaginal-discharge/).

***

Thrush symptoms in men:

* irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
* a white discharge - it may look like cottage cheese
* an unpleasant smell
* difficulty pulling back the foreskin

***

Thrush can affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, groin and between the fingers. This causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with white or yellow discharge.

<p class="font-small">Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service, where you don’t need an appointment. They’ll often get test results quicker than GP practices</p>

!!!warning
It’s important to get thrush in men diagnosed to rule out other things like [balanitis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Balanitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx) or a [sexually transmitted infection (STI)](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sexually-transmitted-infections/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 
!!!

### What happens at your appointment

Your GP or sexual health clinic will want to rule out other infections.  

* you'll be asked about your symptoms
* a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina or penis
* a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge to test for other infections

You often get the results quicker from a sexual health clinic, typically 1 to 2 days, and around 1 week from you GP practice. 

## Thrush treatment

You'll need anti-fungal medicine to get rid of thrush. This can be tablet you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary) or a cream to relieve the irritation. 

Thrush should clear up within a week, after one dose of medicine or using the cream daily. 

You don't need to treat partners, unless they have symptoms. 

### Recurrent thrush

You'll need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than twice in 6 months).  

Your GP or sexual health clinic can help you identify if something is triggering your thrush, such as your period or sex. 

### Your pharmacist can help with thrush

You can buy anti-fungal medicine from pharmacies if you've had thrush diagnosed in the past and you know the symptoms.  

Your pharmacist can recommend the best treatment for you.  Ask if they have a private area to talk if you're embarrassed.

You shouldn't use antifungal medicine more than twice in 6 months without speaking to your pharmacist or doctor.

## What causes thrush

Thrush isn't classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) but it can be triggered by sex and sometimes passed on through sex. 

Thrush is caused by a fungus called candida that most people have on their skin.  It can develop if the balance of bacteria changes. 

This can happen if:

* your skin is irritated or damaged
* you’re taking antibiotics 
* you have a weakened immune system - for example because of HIV or chemotherapy
* you have poorly controlled diabetes
* after the menopause
* when you’re pregnant

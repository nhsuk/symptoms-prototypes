## How to treat shingles at home

You can buy painkillers to ease shingles pain.

!!! warning
It can take up to 4 weeks for the rash to heal. Pain can stay for weeks
after the rash has gone, but it usually settles in time.
!!!

### Do

* keep the rash clean and dry to reduce risk of infection
* wear loose-fitting clothing
* buy calamine lotion to ease itching
* use a cool compress (a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel
  or a wet cloth) a few times a day

### Don’t

* let dressings or plasters stick to the rash
* use antibiotic cream --- this slows healing

## Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles

Try to avoid:

* pregnant women who have not had chickenpox before
* people with a weakened immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS
* babies less than one month old (unless it is your own baby, as they
  should be protected from the virus by your immune system)

## Stay off work or school until the rash scabs

Shingles is contagious only while the rash oozes fluid.

## Shingles and pregnancy

If you’re pregnant and get shingles, there is no danger to your
pregnancy or baby.

If your GP thinks you need medicine, they may speak to a specialist to
decide whether the benefits of medication outweigh any possible risk.

## You can’t get shingles from chickenpox

You can’t get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.

However, you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles, if you
haven’t had chickenpox before.

When people get chickenpox, the virus remains in the body. It can be
reactivated later and cause shingles if someone’s immune system is
lowered. This can be because of stress, certain conditions or treatments
like chemotherapy.

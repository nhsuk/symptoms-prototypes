## How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading

Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads easily.

Keep your child away from school or nursery while they're feeling
unwell. Generally, there's no need to keep them off until the blisters
scab. However, check with your school or nursery as they may have their
own guidance.

## Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy

It’s best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and
mouth disease.

There’s normally no risk to the pregnancy or baby. However, there’s
limited evidence that in very rare cases catching it during the first
3 months of pregnancy could lead to miscarriage. This risk is very low.

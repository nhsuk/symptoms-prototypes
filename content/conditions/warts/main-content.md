## Warts often go away on their own

You don’t need to do anything about warts. They’ll usually go away
within 2 years.

Warts don’t cause you any harm. They might itch or bleed but it doesn’t
mean there’s a problem.

If you are unsure or worried about a growth on your skin you should see
your GP.

!!! warning
Warts on your vulva, penis or anus are [genital warts](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genital_warts/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
and need treatment. Go to a sexual health clinic or see your GP.

## Treating warts that are bothering you

You can treat warts if they’re bothering you, they keep coming back or
they’re painful.

### Treatments from your pharmacy

You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to get rid of
warts. These treatments can take up to 3 months, they can irritate your
skin and they don’t always work.

Ask your pharmacist for advice on what to use if you have a condition
such as diabetes.

!!! warning
Don’t use pharmacy treatments on your face. See your GP instead.

### Treatment from your GP

Your GP may be able to freeze warts off. If the wart is big, it may
take more than one session. After treatment, the wart should fall off a few
weeks later.

Check with your GP if the NHS pays for this treatment in your area.

If treatment hasn’t worked or you have a wart on your face, your GP might
refer you to a skin specialist. Other treatments include minor surgery and
treatment with laser or light.
